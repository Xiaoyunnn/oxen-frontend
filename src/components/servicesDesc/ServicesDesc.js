        We believe in supplying only high quality, reliable products. If your
        equipment is not performing up to expectations, or if you simply need
        advice on operating it, our dedicated team of staff will be ready to
        assist you. If the issue can’t be resolved over the phone or emails, we
        kindly request that you send your equipment to us for inspection. If
        this is not possible, we’ll have someone down at your site as soon as we
        can to assess the situation.
