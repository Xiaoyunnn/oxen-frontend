          Our specialties include CCTV for tower crane, time lapse CCTV. As a
          service provider recognised by the regulators, we advise and assist
          contractors to ensure that the CCTV met all the compliance
          requirements set forth by the regulators. We use the wireless and
          solar technology to capture video image continually at work site, and
          work progress will be fed back to the site office. This will help to
          monitor the works progress and identify should there be any lapses in
          safety.
